## Overview

I created an application where users can post travel landmark photos in a social media style while giving real tips, recommendations, and ratings to those locations. Other users are able to browse these posts, favorite the ones that may be helpful for an upcoming trip, and can use these recommendations to guide their itinerary creation! Users can view a feed of all posts to gain ideas, or choose to look at the post feed of one specific landmark. They can also view their own posts on their profile page. A user does not need to be logged in to browse the posts, but must be logged in in order to create posts and to favorite posts.

This process consolidates the research that a traveler would need to do when creating an itinerary and deciding where they should go, how much time to spend there, and what is worth the wait.

I hope you find this helpful too!
